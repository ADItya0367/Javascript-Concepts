Look Javascript code can be used at different places
 
1-Inside the Head- here we are defining the js inside the head tag and in order to do that we have to call the function and for calling we have to use events , here using the Onclick Events and events are mainly specified inside the forms see below .and is declared inside the body tag



<html>
<head>
function msg()
{
  alert("This is an example of Head Js")
}
</head>
<body>
<form>
<input type="button" value="click"onclick="msg()"/>
</form>
<p> Welcome to My World </p>
</body>
</html>
